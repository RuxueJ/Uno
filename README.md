## Game Overview - UNO 
Uno is a popular card game that is played with a specially printed deck. The game is designed for 2 to 6 players. The objective of Uno is to be the first player to score 500 points by being the first to play all the cards in their hand. 
<br />
Players take turns matching a card in their hand with the current card shown on top of the deck either by color or number. Special action cards like "Skip," "Reverse," and "Draw Two" add elements of strategy and surprise to the game. The game continues until a player has no cards left, at which point they are declared the winner of the round and score points based on the cards remaining in other players' hands. The game is then reset, and a new round begins.
<br />
We will implement our project based on the basic uno game roles.
